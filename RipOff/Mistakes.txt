This is a list of errors and lessons learned along the way!

#Let classes handle the arrays and lists to which they belong. Don't externally create an array and then use
e[n] = New E.

	Whycome is that then the class itself isn't really aware of the list, and also it forces external code to keep track of the class itself.
	It seems like classes should really have their own built-in instance-wranglin'. You'd just tell the class you need more of what it does, and it's all "Fine."
	

	
#When copying code from elsewhere, really study it closely. Just because your version doesn't work doesn't mean you can never figure it out. Code is super-fickle. 
	It will break whenever it wants and with very little reason.
